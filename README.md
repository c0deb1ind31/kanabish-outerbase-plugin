## Kanabish: a Kanban board plugin for Outerbase with Slack integration
Kanabish is a plugin for Outerbase that adds a Kanban board view to your database table. A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps you manage your workflow by dividing it into stages or columns. Each stage represents a step in your process, and each item in the stage represents a task or a record. You can drag and drop items from one stage to another as they progress through the workflow. Kanabish lets you create a Kanban board from any table in your database, and customize the stages and the fields to display.

But that's not all. Kanabish also integrates with Slack, the popular communication platform for teams. You can set up a Slack channel for your Kanban board, and get notified whenever an item changes its status. This way, you can keep track of your progress, collaborate with your teammates, and get feedback from your stakeholders.
